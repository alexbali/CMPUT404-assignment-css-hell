                        <p>I am a 21-year old student currently studying Computer Science at the University of Alberta. My long term ambitions revolve around securing a management position in the IT industry. In the short term, I aspire to gain valuable interpersonal experience while at the same time saving for my education. I'm intelligent, punctual, organized and a quick learner with an incredibly strong work ethic. </p>

                        <h3>City of Edmonton</h3>
                        <p>I designed and developed a web application using Oracle Application Express (Oracle APEX). I met with clients to gather business requirements and scheduled weekly meetings (with 2 - 5 people present) to keep them updated on the progress of the application while simultaneously getting their feedback. I wrote the user acceptance tests (UAT) and conducted them with the clients, created a user manual and migrated the application from the test environment to the production environment. I also worked on a side project that involved automating data analysis using Apps Script.</p>
                        <h3>URI</h3>
                        <p>I primarily marshaled in planes and ensured that bags made it on to the correct plane. I was in charge of teams of up to 7 members. I trained new employees and walked them through all airport security measures and safety protocols. I was also responsible for communicating with both pilots and customer service representatives.</p>
